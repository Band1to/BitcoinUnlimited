Bitcoin Unlimited
==========

Bitcoin Unlimited is a patch set on top of Bitcoin XT. It removes BIP101 and changes the blocksize to infinity. 

Unlimited uses the same data directories as Core so you can easily switch back and forth. You will keep and continue updating the same block chain.
 
Development process
===================

There is no development process except in the sense of making sure an infinite blocksize actually keeps working. Like DDOS protection, sensible soft limits and orphan limits. 

In other words we completely support all patches of XT on top of Bitcoin Core, except BIP101.
